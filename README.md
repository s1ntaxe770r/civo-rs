# civo-rs
Unofficial rust client for the civo api

## Why ? 
Because Civo's go client wasn't fast enough ðŸ˜…. This is purely for educational purposes as i am trying to get better at rust ,this also means that a large part of this code is bad and more expreienced rust devs would be disgusted by it. See something that isn't right? Open a PR as i mentioned earlier i am doing this to improve and would appreciate any feedback and or help i can get. 

## project goals 

Right now there aren't many i would like to mimic as much civo's go client as possible, however i am focused on some of the core functionalities right now 

- [x] managing ssh keys
- [x] creating compute instances 
- [ ] creating kubernetes clusters
- [ ] managing object stores 



## How do i use this thing

ðŸ˜… yeah still working on that
